# SL-Check My Stops
Based on the Bish-Bosh CSS template. Constructed in two days after wrestling with multiple APIs (Typeahead, Realtime, Location, DepartureBoard) that were screaming at a confused me.
Was humiliated by the first two APIs, but I conquered against the last two. ðŸ’ª

Javascript API implementation is terrifying. Perhaps the first two APIs were too powerful for my novice prowess.
